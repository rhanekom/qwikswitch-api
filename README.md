# qwikswitch-api

A Python wrapper for the [Qwikswitch API](https://qwikswitch.com/doc/), used for remotely controlling [Qwikswitch](https://qwikswitch.com/) devices using the [Wifi Bridge](https://www.qwikswitch.co.za/products/wifi-bridge).

An alternative (local) way of controlling Qwikswitch devices is with a USB Modem.  If this is the device that you have, see the [pyqwikswitch library](https://github.com/kellerza/pyqwikswitch) instead.
